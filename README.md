# IPA Reference

A site for looking up IPA [(International Phonetic Alphabet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) transcriptions for words in English.
I created this site for any other linguistics fans, researchers, or language learners who want to find IPA transcriptions quickly (i.e. with less clicks on sites that provide them).

## TODO

- Add a UK dictionary
- TTS (if there are options that don't cost $$$)
